# LungCancer_LabIACD

## Description
The LIDC-IDRI dataset is a lung cancer screening resource that includes thoracic CT scans from 1,010 patients. It contains annotated lung nodules categorized into three groups: (a) nodules with a diameter of 3 mm or larger, (b) nodules smaller than 3 mm, and (c) non-nodules that are 3 mm or larger. These annotations were produced through a two-phase review process conducted by four experienced radiologists.
We will be using these images as input data, for Lung Cancer classification and we will be developing a Data Science-based solution.
